# iovis

iovis is a fast compiled language with a strong focus on performance and convenience.

## Hello World

A simple Hello World program can be written as such

```rust
fn main() {
    printf("Hello World");
}
```
## Usage/Examples

lib.iov
```rust
extern {
    fn printf(format: string, ..);
    fn scanf(format: string, ..): i32;
    fn fgets(format: string, n: i32, stream: i32): string;
}
```

main.iov

```rust
import lib;

fn main() {
    let input: i32;

    printf("What's your favorite number?\n");
    scanf("%d", &input);

    if input != 12 {
        printf("Wrong");
    } else {
        printf(":-)");
    }
}
```
